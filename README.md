**BOF Description:**

**appnumberBOF:** Counts the number of installed applications via the registry, de-duplicates, and prints. Applied to large number of beacons we can see differences in app number quantity and infer certain things about that device.

**amsi-etw-ping-BOF:** Checks for AMSI and ETW presence in the current process by detecting loaded DLLs and ETW-related exports. Applied to large number of beacons, we will be able to pick targets that have less security activity.
